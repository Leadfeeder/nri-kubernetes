## Unreleased

## 1.0.0-beta2

### Added
- Metrics for unscheduled Pods.

### Fixed
- Fix format of inherited labels. Remove unnecessary prefix `label_` included by kube-state-metrics.
- Fix labels inheritance. Labels weren't propagating between "entities" correctly.

### Changed
- `updatedAt` metric was renamed to `podsUpdated`.
- `cpuUsedCores` has been divided by 10^9, to show actual cores instead of nanocores.

## 1.0.0-beta

  Pods and Containers. This data is fetched from two different sources: Kubelet
  and kube-state-metrics.
